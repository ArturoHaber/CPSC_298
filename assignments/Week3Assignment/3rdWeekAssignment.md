I prompted v0 for a factory dashboard with three main pages, home, analytics, and fleet. Here is my prompt:

Generate a sleek and professional looking frontend for a factory/manufacturing plant to be able to look at data collected in their system. I visualize a sidebar with three different pages. Main page with immediate stats and access to important tools, an analytics/data page where you have access to a factory map-like interface where you can move around and scroll through the map to see different machines, and you can click on the machine to see the data. The third page I visualize a fleet section where you can see all of your devices, their name, a color for their status (green up, red down, yellow inactive). The overall UI is very modern and new looking in the sublimeness of the look and feel of the site. Very responsive with clicks and such. I trust you will do a good job

I then had a back and forth conversation that guided me on how to setup and run the npm server.

In my codebase are all the different pages. That where provided and part of the app.

After week 5 I downloaded and used aider to further request code through the command line
